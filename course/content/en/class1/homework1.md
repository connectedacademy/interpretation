## Re-visit

Most depictions of addiction portray individuals at the far end of the spectrum, typically focusing on drug use--whether the emphasis is on crack, crystal meth, or heroin, the majority of the images we see show people living on the streets or in dirty depressing environments, with bad teeth and skin and vacant eyes. Even though we know that people can hold down jobs and hide a serious habit from their friends, colleagues, and families, that's not what we picture when we think about addiction. In reality, addiction (often referred to as a [substance use disorder](https://www.samhsa.gov/disorders/substance-use)) can be diagnosed long before someone's destructive behavior is obvious, and it can involve a variety of substances including marijuana and alcohol.

Having listened to the interviews and reflected on the subsequent discussions and feedback, you should revisit and amend your original 4Corners submission or submit an entirely new response that depicts addiction in one of these earlier stages, or in a way that goes beyond the typical images we see. Please provide critique and support to fellow participants.

Follow [the instructions](/markdown/fourcorners.md) to create and upload your submission.
