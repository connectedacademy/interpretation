00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,899
Hello my name is Jonathan Worth and as
well as being freelance photographer I'm

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,760
also a researcher at Newcastle
University's open lab in the UK the

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,540
interviews you're about to hear are part
of a series that along with the web

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,640
platform and connected classes seek to
create a space for critical engagement

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,240
with visual storytelling the
relationship between the photographer

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,170
the subject and the audience the three
stakeholders in every photograph a

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,220
central to the talking pictures
interviews but there are occasions when

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,809
those stakeholders might not be three
different people in the case of the

9
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,290
self-portrait the photographer and the
subject to the same person in the case

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,950
of the selfie that isn't shared or
published the photographer the subject

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,010
and the audience are one and the same
the theme for this session is

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,640
interpretation and the people who have
agreed to help us think about that are

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,050
the Scottish photographer Graham a
can-do and the u.s. journalist Susan

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,100
Stellan for reasons that will become
clear

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,660
Graham chose not to share his
self-portraits for over ten years

16
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,049
and many of the images from this series
and from this time in his life he's

17
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,790
still not chosen to publish both him and
Susan reflect on the ethical

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,270
implications of representing other
people the duty of care for the

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,170
vulnerable and they consider how the
effect and impact of an image might be

20
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,680
felt long after it was made and long
after the subject may have moved on with

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,570
their life I first met Graham in New
York in 1998 he helped me find a place

22
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,460
to live and help me find places to work
he was intense he was brash with his

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,520
thick Scottish accent that he refused to
let go of and he was funny he was

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,390
generous he was very caring of his
friends and he was successful as well he

25
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,320
was shooting news shooting huge jobs he
was travelling all over the world it was

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,729
someone who was constantly in motion
both figuratively and literally he was

27
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,189
also a compulsive collector both of the
ephemeral and an images everything had a

28
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,840
story attached to it and everything was
super tasteful as well to this day the

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,799
photographs of that period of my life
that hang in my home were made by Graham

30
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,079
we moved away from New York at the end
of 2001 and towards the end it had

31
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,060
become harder and harder to keep up with
him by 2005 it was impossible and it

32
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,150
remains a regret that we lost
back in the UK news of Graham now was

33
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,640
coming second and third-hand I learned
that he he'd got divorced I'd learned

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,900
that he wasn't working anymore
I learned that there'd been a newspaper

35
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,099
report of an explosion at his house that
he'd been arrested and that finally he

36
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:34,610
was in prison as you listen to this
interview you'll hear from Graham the

37
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,950
photographer Graham the subject and
Graham the publisher you'll hear how

38
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,640
even is Louis Debbie was still
considering the ethical implications of

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,500
making other people's images and how he
and Susan chose to share the work taking

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,849
into consideration how the contexts
would affect how the various audiences

41
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:57,140
would interpret it and be affected and
so it's fitting that susan has the last

42
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,209
word not only on this story but also on
this interview itself there are also

43
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,440
links to related bodies of work but
along with this material should inform a

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,150
critical discourse about vulnerability
responsibilities and how we choose to

45
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,099
represent issues and so frame the
conversations around them Graeme my

46
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:21,799
name's Graham maganda and speaking to
you guys from Brooklyn New York and my

47
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,489
living room and you might hear a few
Kerrigan bikers I'm pretty close to the

48
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:32,389
expressway I grew up in Scotland between
Edinburgh and Glasgow and you know I

49
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:38,450
spent a lot of my youth being into music
and specifically punk music in the late

50
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,450
seventies and through the 80s and I went
to art school in Edinburgh where I

51
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,269
actually studied painting and then
London I went to the Royal College which

52
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,739
was quite a jump for me because I hadn't
studied photography at all I'd study

53
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:59,329
pinning but I'd always taken photographs
and somehow I managed again to the Royal

54
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:03,230
College which was still pretty amazing
in Malaga and if it was very prestigious

55
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,930
at the time and then after two years at
the Royal College where I met my

56
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:15,680
then-girlfriend and had my son Liam
there I moved to New York to follow a

57
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,340
career in photography

58
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,310
when I first moved to New York I wasn't
sure what I was going to do in

59
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,480
photography I knew I wanted to work
within the field of photography I fallen

60
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,550
in love with it and was pretty
passionate about it but but five years I

61
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,230
spent working in galleries but because I
was always taking pictures eventually

62
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,170
moved on and working commercially as a
photographer before I knew I was

63
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,380
photographing for a lot of magazines
working on commercial ad campaigns

64
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,150
getting flown all over the world to do
annual reports and it's photographing

65
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,280
gary oldman I photographed Michael
Jackson I got sent a film set so I was

66
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,200
photographing you know for Nike and ESPN
so the trajectory at that point was

67
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,340
really really quick for me it wasn't am
I really in business for myself was

68
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,360
walking at that level as a commercial
photographer people would do stuff for a

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,050
year and so it was very fun I mean I was
always really surprised with people

70
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,840
through money and then give you money to
buy your breakfast in your lunch and a

71
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,580
cup of coffee and someone help you and I
taxi and all that stuff but that world

72
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,780
which really surprises me very very
surprising to me even I thought that I

73
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,710
was it was too much money sometimes and
I was getting paid it but of course not

74
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,360
all photography is really well kid you
know I mean journalism and editorial I

75
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,200
think is you can make a livin that it's
a good living but yet you're not getting

76
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,080
paid what you're getting paid for
shooting advertising campaigns and

77
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,330
that's where the real money comes in it
was interested be you know in a position

78
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,710
where people would call you up and say
hey you're available next week would

79
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,380
like to send you a la Randy Newman or
done an article on them but I've often

80
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,340
found that as the people that you get
sent that they have an interest and

81
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:07,150
story about them that are known that
celebrity banned words that are more

82
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,780
inclined could give you more time and
more implanted reveals things about the

83
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,660
cell even if you don't agree where I've
photographed some people that

84
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,980
politically I might know he was a you
know some of their stances I'm just like

85
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,480
wow but they also dress never done that
reveal something me about how other

86
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,070
people love that light those jobs are
more fulfilling for me you know I

87
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,390
enjoyed that so a you know meeting these
people have known the public eye

88
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,230
might be done some that slightly
interesting in Psalms picked up on it

89
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,820
and saw some magazines did a feature on
it I started working as a photographer

90
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,500
because I was someone who was always
taking pictures to portraits of friends

91
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,670
that have landscapes I did a photograph
livin that was going on around me you

92
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,720
know because I really loved photography
I still take pictures now I've always

93
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,690
taken pictures I mean I just sometimes I
think it's are almost like an affliction

94
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,960
I encourage all my students to keep
sketchbooks and not boots you know I

95
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,860
don't like them you take it out and
write notes on the phones I like them to

96
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,880
be carrying sketchbooks you know I tell
them and I send them on the first day in

97
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,540
class at the end of the semester
go to the store it's your fun the corner

98
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,650
spend five bucks buy a sketchbook and
just write your ideas and then scribble

99
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,860
ideas and if you find a piece of paper
or a picture on the street or a Polaroid

100
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,730
or whatever as stick it in there when
you look back through it will be much

101
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,900
more meaningful than a note on your
iPhone that you can delete accidentally

102
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,610
and doesn't have any real as their take
value after all thereby I'd like to get

103
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,350
my students to do a lot you know people
especially know people are very

104
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,550
interested in seeing what your vision is
and what you can bring to the table as

105
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:50,740
opposed to what you've brought to the
table for other people so I've had

106
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,190
several years of working as a really
successful commercial photographer

107
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,570
working editorially working for
advertising agencies flying are in the

108
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,860
world being lucky enough to meet
celebrities and you know such a dream

109
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:09,550
world of a photographer to be perfectly
honest with you but during that period

110
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:16,330
that started drinking too much I started
dabbling with drugs and it just took me

111
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,840
off at a tangent that I never ever
really expected in my life you know I

112
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,420
slowly but surely and Betty insidiously
the drugs kicked in and I became a very

113
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:35,770
very bad heroin and crack cocaine addict
I first met grandma can do in 2002 when

114
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,090
we were both part of the same summer
house out in Montauk as the end of Long

115
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,930
Island near New York at the time he was
working as a commercial photographer

116
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,800
her there were a lot of us who kind of
came and went to that house over the

117
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,690
course of the summer and I really just
knew him as someone who partied a bit

118
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,940
and drink I would say more than the
average person at the time he had a

119
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,670
girlfriend and we sort of lost touch
over that after that summer then I

120
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,370
reached out to him in 2005 when I needed
an author photo taken for a travel book

121
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:16,880
I'd written and went over to get my
picture taken at that point Graham

122
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,990
wasn't in that relationship anymore I
wasn't in a relationship and by the end

123
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,660
of that very long photoshoot in that
afternoon

124
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,889
the next day he asked me out on a date
I was living on the Upper West Side he

125
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:31,769
was living in Brooklyn and New York we
joked that that's sort of a

126
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:35,850
long-distance relationship you know we
really only saw each other on weekend so

127
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,889
it took a while for me to realize that
there was something a little bit off

128
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:50,430
about him we tend to see and experience
addiction as viewers at the extreme end

129
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,569
of the spectrum you know we don't really
have a popular conception of the

130
00:09:54,569 --> 00:10:00,120
functional addict so for me the idea
that Graham could be functional as a

131
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,720
photographer and a guy that I would be
interested in dating at first people

132
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,459
just would ask well how could you not
have known it wasn't obvious to me and

133
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:15,689
you know we have pictures from a trip we
took to Hawaii and my mom when she saw

134
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:20,819
this photo she said oh he looked so
wholesome unbeknownst to me or really

135
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:26,550
anyone else he was using heroin at the
time I was still working for many years

136
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,149
during our times Arthur I'm still
working I'm making money I'm not that

137
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:34,529
bad you know this it just appears I'm
going through but you know as you get

138
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:38,790
more and more in it drugs your awareness
if where you are and what's going on

139
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:46,860
with you feathers away and but the time
I so realized and tried to dance number

140
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:54,420
I was really deepen I eventually found
out that Graham was using drugs when I

141
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,399
found him sitting on the couch in his
house at the crack pipe for a variety of

142
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:05,550
reasons I didn't end up breaking up with
him right then so I sort of stuck around

143
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:12,290
for a while you know and then until it
became apparent that he really just

144
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:17,129
wasn't getting the help and I thought me
being continuing a relationship was

145
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:19,870
actually hurting things more than was
helping and

146
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,730
think I had this feeling that you know
we all have that sort of tough love if I

147
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:33,040
just walk away you know that's going to
motivate him to quit I've always taken

148
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,210
pictures and even in the depths of my
addiction where I didn't work

149
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:42,610
commercially for years I was my whole
life was unraveling and isolating myself

150
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,550
from everyone that I knew and I was on a
very very slippery dark downhill path I

151
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:54,400
was still taking pictures but it wasn't
only the pictures that I was taken that

152
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,820
were so from that period I collected all
the being a compulsive collector of

153
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,870
things in my whole life and so I was
intrigued by the design of the heroin

154
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,370
baggies that I was buying around New
York City I didn't see it as collect at

155
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,610
a time I just kept them because I was
intrigued by them I love the designs I

156
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,540
love the quirky little pictures with
guns and cartoon characters and you know

157
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,710
statements on them that were just
totally over the top sometimes so I'd be

158
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,510
sticking them in books at little boxes
and stuff like that and also just other

159
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,020
things that were going on around me you
know I was writing in scrapbooks you

160
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,010
know I was keeping letters I was keeping
I got arrested a number a time I kept

161
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,170
the arrest warrants I kept all that
stuff court appearances we have paper

162
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,900
stuck them in boxes I was surprised when
I came through all that stuff and got

163
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,740
myself clean and a couple of different
friends of mine had stuck stuff in

164
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,400
storage or kept things in their houses
for me and I started pulling that stuff

165
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,810
together I started finding other stuff
again I started finding the heroin

166
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,190
baggies and the nut boots and the
Polaroids and the undeveloped rolls a 35

167
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,920
mil film and 120 film and and then I
started finding all these cards hundreds

168
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,670
and hundreds of pictures I had taken
during those years over maybe six or

169
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,480
seven years and no really not knowing I
was doing it and sometimes looking on

170
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,810
sometimes now looking on and sometimes
losing the cards and sometimes having

171
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:22,540
the cameras stolen by other junkies I
didn't feel I had the right to show the

172
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,410
pictures of the other people that I'd
photographed because the concent where

173
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,860
we were and it's a very very difficult
thing you'll see and do a lot of things

174
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,290
in an addict and see everyone's okay
then

175
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,490
the reality of day when you're clean you
just go my god I would never do or say

176
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,980
that so I've decided to make it all
about me another point in the code of

177
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,630
ethics is give special consideration to
vulnerable subjects and that's something

178
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,380
that graham has addressed and explaining
why he decided not to photograph other

179
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,810
addicts is this issue of consent
you know we recognize now that someone

180
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,000
who is addicted to drugs and has a
serious problem you know they have

181
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,319
difficulties with decision-making and
making rational choices so to say that

182
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:09,880
this person can consent to having their
picture taken and then published I think

183
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,100
is a bit problematic because you know we
recognize that you know they aren't

184
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,680
really making decisions that are
informed by rational choices and I think

185
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,350
that is something that we really need to
think about because that person might

186
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,639
get clean and then later regret that
their images out in the world you know

187
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,170
showing them at their worst moment and
they can't take it back I had started

188
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,709
taking photographs of the people are run
me in their environment and sometimes

189
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,430
I've ended up in the pictures and then
it just felt more pertinent for me to

190
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,690
photograph myself because I was living
that life and I shouldn't really be

191
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,069
pointing the camera at other people I
felt I should be pointed out myself

192
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:57,010
so fast forward a few years and I had
lost touch with him at that point he had

193
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:04,240
really gone downhill we kept in touch
occasionally via email but then he sort

194
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,310
of just disappeared off the radar and I
started reaching out to a couple other

195
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,029
people who had known him just sort of
under the assumption that maybe he'd

196
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:17,560
overdose because his phone had been
turned off the website you know he used

197
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,750
to promote his photography was offline I
mean I spent close to a decade in my

198
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,319
life juggling too much drinking dabbling
with drugs tonin a serious addiction and

199
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:34,209
everyone that went along with that and I
kept telling myself that I could get

200
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,839
clean on my own and I kept thinking over
some I could do just to willpower and

201
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,529
strands and it's just like I just need
to buckle down and dare but you know I

202
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:45,610
was totally incapable that strangely
enough the most devastating thing for me

203
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,559
at that
was a finally been arrested and

204
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:51,939
sentenced to six months in Rikers Island
which is a prison on an island on the

205
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:55,929
outskirts of New York City and I think
it's one of the biggest penal colonies

206
00:15:55,929 --> 00:16:00,009
in the world which totally blew me away
because it was somewhere I never ever

207
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:04,059
thought I would end up and so I call
turkeys in a cell and Rikers Island

208
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:08,349
where it was a really really painful
thing you know the physicality of it and

209
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:13,989
then once you get that system a little
but the readjusting in your body to be

210
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:19,389
in clean and then psychologically the
you know realization of where the last

211
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:23,439
several years of your life have been a
really crushing you know I mean it's a

212
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:28,659
really really tough time for me but I
also gave me that moment a Clara is the

213
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:32,829
collet where I so it could look back and
say wow I just put myself through this

214
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:36,970
and my friends so that's my family
through this and thinking the collateral

215
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,269
damage to my mom and my dad and my
friends and my son and over him was

216
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:43,720
really big by the time I tracked him
down he was actually due to be released

217
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,470
from Rikers and rather than getting
released he ended up in Homeland

218
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,779
Security custody and was very quickly
moved to detention centers in first in

219
00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:00,309
downtown Manhattan and then in New
Jersey and then Pennsylvania so I

220
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:04,240
managed to get someone at the prison
where he was being held in Pennsylvania

221
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,189
to give him my phone number and that's
when we reconnected I was in a County

222
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:12,459
Jail in Pennsylvania that had an
immigration wing and I found out they

223
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,939
had a 24/7 cognitive behavioral therapy
program in there for four months and

224
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,429
that's that's how I got clean
essentially was in a prison

225
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:26,439
rehabilitation program and it set the
groundwork for me to when I got to build

226
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,259
on that and I've been clean ever since
which is seven years on like that we

227
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:37,600
talked on the phone we exchanged these
really intense letters and you know by

228
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,549
the time his final hearing was coming up
it was as lawyer who actually asked if I

229
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:46,960
would be okay with Graham coming to stay
with me for a while if he got released

230
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,930
so all of a sudden he was on a bus
getting out at

231
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,160
the Port Authority Terminal near Times
Square in New York and that was the

232
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,120
first time we saw each other when we
were not separated by Plexiglas that was

233
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,610
the first time I seen him in almost two
years so he came to stay with me and

234
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:12,760
he's still here could never get rid of
him we actually just got married in May

235
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:24,640
of 2017 but when he was released
maybe not nine months clean but also

236
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,970
having spent nine months incarcerated so
he wasn't gram the photographer I think

237
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,679
he didn't know who he was and that was
the process of rebuilding you know not

238
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,010
just from that time away from everything
but also almost a decade of addiction so

239
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,000
it was a long process I mean he at first
he didn't have any interest in picking

240
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,920
up a camera he would go to a grocery
store and just stand in the aisles kind

241
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,240
of mystified by the amount of choice
that you had because all that's taken

242
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,320
away when you're incarcerated you know
he didn't have any interest in having a

243
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,710
phone he didn't have any interest in a
computer you know it took a long time

244
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,480
for Graham to you know feel pleasure
again from the things that I feel

245
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,950
pleasure from you know whether it's a
great meal or sex or running or

246
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,130
photography you know and that's because
your brain changes from addiction you

247
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,429
know particularly with dopamine's and
you know I don't think people get

248
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:25,890
prepared for how long that's going to
take

249
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:34,570
so now that I'm being clean for a bit
and I've started pulling together my

250
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:40,540
life and have rediscovered all this a
ephemera and stuff the photographs the

251
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:46,450
baggies the notebooks the Polaroids all
that sort of stuff from the use of

252
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,010
addiction I'd spent a lot of time
looking through them and it was somewhat

253
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:56,380
upsetting for me and I say looking at
these because even though I was clean

254
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,210
none I was happy I was clean and I was
near 100% comfortable talking to people

255
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:06,340
about what I've been through because I
was still in that place that said as an

256
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,060
addict your shame-based because it's not
like some that you boast about as being

257
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,630
a heroine addict or a crack addict or
some that you're pretty shamed of you

258
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,310
know so as a difficult thing to reveal
if people and some people alive people

259
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,260
knew about it some people didn't and I
would bump into people who would say oh

260
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,140
where have you been the last few year
have the healthy fairy jeez what was

261
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,250
being good on and the last thing you
want to say is oh hey it's good to see

262
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,570
you I've been a heroin addict I was
locked up in prison the first time I saw

263
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,400
them I mean it was just gut-wrenching
and it was it was so devastating but

264
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,890
also at the same time compelling because
it showed me what Graham had been up to

265
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:50,740
in these rooms and stairwells and places
that I'd never seen and I actually wrote

266
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:57,730
about it in a journal at the time where
I kind of described that attraction and

267
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,720
this voyeurism to wanting to know about
this part of his life he'd kept hidden

268
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,360
but then also how sad it was because
what Graham chose to show was so much

269
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,370
loneliness and in all the photos you
know by and large he's by himself and

270
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,830
just what his life had been reduced to
it took a lot of time looking at him

271
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,430
because some of the pictures were really
really really disturbing and some of the

272
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,350
really disturbing ones I have me put out
there because it's too rough on my

273
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:32,380
family and my wife and myself even
people who see certain images are just

274
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,580
too tough you know they they show me in
a light I just don't want to share when

275
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,850
he did start showing them to people
there were really a range of reactions

276
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,850
and what
friend of ours just you know ran crying

277
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:47,560
from the room when she first saw them it
was hard looking at it was hard walking

278
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,250
at who the audience would be why would I
want to show who would this resonate

279
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,790
with and what would be their takeaway it
was like I took these pictures of myself

280
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,800
and this is what I went through and I
want you to understand people end up in

281
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,320
this situation and what they goes
through and that they can recover as

282
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,740
well really important to me the you know
the takeaway for this is that you can go

283
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,330
through this stuff and you can recover
I think that's missing PA addiction for

284
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,410
SES and stuff like that is people a
perfect laugh it photographs the addicts

285
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,540
the junkies the torn down buildings or
the desolate isolated places and they're

286
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,070
always a lot of the times in victims and
they always never seem to recover and

287
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,480
never seems to be an end story about
really look at these addicts so I want

288
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,950
you to show look at this addict coming
from me as the recovered addict when

289
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,090
Graham first started talking about or
proposing that he might show these

290
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,090
images to some photo editors or think
about publishing them or exhibiting them

291
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,790
my first reaction was that that was a
really scary thought you know not

292
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,630
negative that he shouldn't do it but
just concern about how these images

293
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:01,300
would be interpreted so one of the
things that I suggested is that if he

294
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,550
was going to publish these images that
he include text accompanying the images

295
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:11,590
that he tell his story so that he could
to some degree shape how people reacted

296
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,720
to them my response from magazines was
immediate I sent emails to a couple of

297
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,470
picture editors was a couple in baby
pictures and was then like half an hour

298
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,070
which is unknown for picture writers
they were back at me saying oh we love

299
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,680
these can you bring them in can you show
us more were really interesting

300
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,390
publishing them we eventually decided to
publish them was text by Susan which was

301
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:39,730
an interview basically and in New York
magazine and it got so much feedback but

302
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,630
because we mulled over it for so long it
was a really well-done piece and it

303
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:49,000
really resonated I was really happy with
it and the feedback from the people that

304
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,100
saw it their audience was
amazing so after the article it first

305
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,910
appeared in New York Magazine in print
and obviously there was an accompanying

306
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,080
piece online that did have the
photography and the text and some audio

307
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,150
we literally sat looking at the computer
waiting for the comments to start

308
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,080
scrolling in there was a person who
thought that Graham had faked to this

309
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,130
whole thing in order to get published
and you know potentially get an exhibit

310
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,650
and that really sparked this thread
about whether or not someone who was a

311
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,640
heroin addict really would have the
capacity to set a self timer and take

312
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,380
pictures of himself and I think that
gets back to this idea that we don't

313
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,250
really understand or believe in the
concept of someone who can be somewhat

314
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,900
functional or in some cases very
functional while using drugs but there

315
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:43,180
are myriad stories of people who you
know have held down careers as doctors

316
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:49,090
surgeons lawyers actors professors and
then it comes out that you know they had

317
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,290
a serious addiction but yet I think
sometimes because we don't see that

318
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:59,230
depicted and visual imagery we just we
can't wrap our heads around it so in a

319
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,010
lot of the Guardian comments there was
just the skepticism was he really a

320
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:08,860
heroin addict was he really using from
there it got picked up by al-jazeera The

321
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:15,130
Huffington Post and that led me to the
Scottish National Portrait Gallery where

322
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:18,790
the curator there approached me and said
listen I've never seen anything like

323
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,480
this before can you bring these to me
and let me see these pictures these are

324
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,430
amazing you know so I went across and
met with her and I took maybe I made a

325
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:32,140
whole bunch of eight by ten prints maybe
the eighth year mainly we looked through

326
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,290
them
I left them was her I came back three

327
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,890
months later we were all that done it
like 50 came back three months later we

328
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:45,480
were all done like 25 images that were
really powerful and succinct and we

329
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,710
submitted them as a board to the
Scottish National Portrait Gallery to

330
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:54,760
see if we could get an acquisition to my
surprise I got it woke up one morning

331
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,390
checked my email and there was an email
from an enlightened who's a curator said

332
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,140
you'll never believe it the dis idea to
acquire all 25 images for the national

333
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,759
collection which was
mind-boggling image they think back

334
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:10,959
they've taken these pictures these dark
places these isolated painful times that

335
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:15,070
you know the hope all through the boards
and committees in the National Portrait

336
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:21,149
Gallery which is a very traditional body
of people found this body of works so

337
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:24,789
compelling and powerful that they were
the quiet of the national collection

338
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:30,039
which is a real really great for me it
was really a catalyst to these

339
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:35,320
conversations that I think people were
really anxious and interested in having

340
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:41,739
so the series of images became sort of a
gateway to these conversations about not

341
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:45,999
just addiction but how do you get clean
you know what is that like what is that

342
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:51,819
process what did you do what helped you
AIESEC Graham's route to recovery is you

343
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:55,659
know something that is going to work for
everybody but I think the more we talk

344
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:59,289
about it the more we can kind of learn
about what works in different

345
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:04,899
circumstances one of the reasons that
we're we mostly see images of addiction

346
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:08,469
and addiction sort of at the far end of
the spectrum is just the shame and the

347
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:13,809
stigma that surrounds you know substance
use disorder the imagery is always about

348
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:19,299
the person who's really lost everything
they're really down and out that's

349
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:24,099
something that's also missing
you know from media and kind of popular

350
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:28,239
representations of addiction is that
recovery piece of it because you know

351
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:33,639
it's maybe not as interesting visually
Graham keeps asking you know how do you

352
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:39,099
depict recovery you know what do you
show about that you know where with

353
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:42,699
addiction I think there is that
voyeurism factor it's something that you

354
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:46,899
know people you know largely haven't
seen although I would argue that maybe

355
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,349
at this point we have seen a lot of
images of needles going into veins or

356
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:56,319
people passed out or you know crack
pipes or drugs kind of close up and I

357
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,849
think where we're at now is kind of
trying to wrap our heads around what is

358
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:06,789
that project or story that you can tell
about how people get clean and sober

359
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:12,039
some people recover without doing you
know a rehab or without going to AAA

360
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:17,229
other people really rely on those peer
supports so I think you know finding a

361
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:20,080
way to capture those
stories and capture that process is

362
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,790
something that we're both really
interested in right now I think it's the

363
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:29,530
most important thing I've I've really
done is put this body work out there and

364
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:35,290
engage with people and you know as
someone who's been the addict and the

365
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,980
recover person and reviewing that part
in my life and trying to take away some

366
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,870
of that shame and trying to take away
some of that negative it is a Sorrows

367
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,490
addiction and giving people that option
that you know what you can go that duck

368
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:53,500
and that deep and end up the places I've
been and still cool yourself at that and

369
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,120
find recovery and built rebuild your
life again and it's now easy there was

370
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,880
times where it were really really really
tough but you know what being clean is

371
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,860
it million times better than being a
headache that's for sure you know so you

372
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,240
know I mean it's been a crazy journey
and a long journey and a tough journey

373
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,330
for some of the friends I've seen me go
through that yourself included but at

374
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,320
least I came away from it with something
that can help change other people's

375
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,770
minds and bring light to what people
mean bill so and that's been really

376
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:42,720
really important for me all right you
got it

377
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,870
is it yes you say nothing that's about

378
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:57,190
so now that you've heard my story and
grand story and listened to you know

379
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:01,600
these interviews I kind of challenge you
to think about what we've talked about

380
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,630
and how much of the focus has been on
addiction and the process of you know

381
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:12,040
going from being a successful
photographer to someone who was had lost

382
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,080
everything and ended up in a prison cell
versus the time spent on you know

383
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,220
talking about in addressing grams
recovery and the treatment he got and

384
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,560
you know how that worked because I think
we all have to step back and see how

385
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,850
we're representing this issue and sort
of challenge ourselves to think about it

386
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,690
in different ways and
so challenge some of the stereotypes we

387
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:37,980
have about what does addiction look like
you know is it just the photographs that

388
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,700
we see of people like Graham who are
slumped over with a needle in their arm

389
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:47,310
and when we talk about it why are we
drawn to that imagery more than two

390
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:53,040
images of people sitting in circles or
interviews of people talking about you

391
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,960
know what they had to overcome the peer
support they got you know and some that

392
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,890
is in some sense it's harder to
photograph it's harder to get access but

393
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,040
that's part of the process that we need
to be seeing and talking about and

394
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,300
thinking about because that's really key
to figuring out what works to help

395
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,470
people who are struggling with addiction
