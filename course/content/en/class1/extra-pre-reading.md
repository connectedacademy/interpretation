description: >-
  The World Press Photo Foundation Archive contains over sixty years of iconic
  images. We have selected some of the recent winners and reimagined them as
  Four Corners Images. It is an example of how 4C can be creatively adapted to
  add rich meta-date to historical images. Instead of the frames before and
  after, we have included contemporaneous and subject-related content and for
  the codes of ethics we have instead substituted the WPPF competition rules.
