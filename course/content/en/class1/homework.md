## This week's task

Insert description of this week's task


## Preparation

There are plenty of photo stories that depict addiction but few that celebrate recovery. In advance of this class author Susan Stellin and photographer Graham Macindoe challenge us to create a four corners image with _Recovery_ as its theme. Use the corners to include supporting images, a backstory, any relevant links, your code of ethics and a copyright notice.

Follow [the instructions](/class/fourcorners.md) to create and upload your submission.
