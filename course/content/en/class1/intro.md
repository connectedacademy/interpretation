## Depictions of Addiction - Introduction

The relationships between the subject, the photographer and the audience are central the Talking Pictures interviews, but there are occasions when those stakeholders might not be three different people. For example, in the case of the self-portrait the photographer and the subject are the same person.The theme for this session is _Interpretation_ and the people whoâ€™ve agreed to help us think about that are the Scottish photographer Graham Macindoe and US journalist Susan Stellin. 

For reasons that will become clear, Graham chose not share his self-portraits for over ten years and you'll hear both him and Susan reflect on the ethical implications of representing other people and the duty of care for the vulnerable.They also invite us to consider what the future impact of publishing photographs might be for subjects who've subsequently moved on with their lives.
