## Depictions of Addiction - Introduction

What we say and what other people hear, are not always the same thing. How people interpret what we say will be affected by all of the different things that go into making us individuals - our gender, age, cultural background, our political biases, even our mood - no, especially our mood.

In this session weâ€™re thinking about how audiences interpret our images. Graham Macindoe and Susan Stellin provide us with a case study. Their story offers us the opportunity to consider both our intended effect on the audience and to consider the potential impact on our subjects.

Questions and links will appear in the transcript, please add your thoughts and reflections into the platform as you listen.
