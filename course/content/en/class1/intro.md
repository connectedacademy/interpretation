## Depictions of Addiction - Introduction

What we say and what other people hear, are not always the same thing. 

How people interpret what we say will be affected by all of the different things that go into making us individuals; our gender, age, cultural background, our political biases, even our mood. On top of that are the external factors such as an audience's social and physical context. 

With digital images the likelihood of them being orphaned, decontextualised and misinterpreted is even greater. In this session weâ€™re thinking about how audiences interpret our images. Scottish photographer Graham Macindoe and U.S. journalist Susan Stellin provide us with a case study. Their story offers us the opportunity to consider we might manage an audience's interpretation, whilst also considering the potential impact on our subjects of the enduring and distributed digital image.

Questions and links will appear in the transcript, please add your thoughts and reflections into the platform as you listen.
